How to generate DataBlocks?

Requirements:
Knowledge of existing Datablocks - through extents

What do we have?
[X] Add files to the File System


Check if the files have extents

If not, all the file must be added

Keep the DataBlock open while new data is added
[X] Simple Datablocks from partial values
Add values to open datablocks

[X] Close DataBlock 
when finish all the session
* Close DataBlock will full the block of zeroes until
the end of the block. 


[ ] Obtain binary values from the extents
at any cost!


[ ] Create copy of the old extents

[ ] Search the location of the extents in the File byte array

[ ] Add the new extents to the list of extents (in order)

[ ] Create new extents from the fraction of existing extents that sill valid


Simple DataBlocks:

Are "dumb" datablocks, small partitions of 
the files associated to the files.
The work as initial approach (when no datablocks)
were generated.
